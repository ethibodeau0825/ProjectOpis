You look around the Control Room. It's not very large, but it's probably the cleanest and most organized part of the ship. Several screens look as they should, automating work that would have been done by a living organism... Had any been alive right now. 

You look around and see an out of place terminal. There is a bright screen telling you the engine is in need of repair. It must be from earlier...      

Your surrounding rooms are locked as well. The Engine Room is one of those locked rooms, to your dismay.

The other rooms are all locked, their keys scattered around. You recall one being in here, a blue key that goes to the Medical Room.
