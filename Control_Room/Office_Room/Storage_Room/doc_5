Condititons are worsening, and we are dying.
JEIF is currently being treated with a mixture of 
Glicerin and the resources found in the mountains on Opis.
While it seems to help for a short amount of time and improve life, 
shortly after the infected start to deteriorate.
Opis is now in its winter cycle once again with its harsh conditiions,
my crew cannot go look for resources. 
We have to wait and see if the new fomula we are curating
can help the infected once more.
