# *Project Opis*
Developed By Elise Thibodeau, Jena Baxter, Faith Yang, Isabel Majdoch

**_Narrative_**

  You are Doctor Olaris Gamma, a resident of Janus and a key component of discovering a cure to a sickness only titled "JEIF." It killed your parents and might even kill your partner if you work any slower. At the moment, you and your late crew are suspended above Planet Opis - a planet filled with life and promising data that could save your people from sickness. Also, your measly crew the company sent with you had grown sick, and most were forced to stay back. The few that remained grew sicker and untreatable from the medicines the crew had created, and the remaining crewmate was now nowhere to be found...

  You worry for your own safety as well now. The ship seems strange after the turbulence, and you need to check the engine. Most of the doors automatically locked during the bout of turbulence, leaving you locked out of the *Med Room*, the *Office*, the *Chemical Lab*, and, to your dismay, the *Engine Room* as well. Your final job, it seems, is to just get home and bring peace of mind to the sickened people of Janus by delving into the data scattered about. You must find whatever damage has been done to the ship as well - else there will be no peace of mind to bring home, let alone a body to return to your partner.

**_Instructions_**

  Use *cd* to move between rooms. Using ls tells you the contents of the directory or lets you see the direct names of the items in the room. The command to look around in the room is "cat observe_*RoomName*", as it offers a more in-depth explanation of what is in the room. Further instructions of usable commands are given as you progress.
