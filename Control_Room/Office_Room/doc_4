We have found inforamtion again! 
Opis proves to have vast mountain rnages, and with that comes resources.
JEIF is taking our citizens faster everyday, 
which means now more than ever we must find a resource on Opis. 
I have sent a team down to the mountains to seach high and low. 
Now we wait for them to retun and tend to the infected on the ship.
