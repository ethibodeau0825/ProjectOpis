Title: The Finalized Cure

At long last, we've finally found a cure to JEIF. After what felt like an eon of trials, errors, and anguish, we have finally cured JEIF in its completion on a patient!
The formula has been copied and sent around the ship as well as delivered back to Janus. Words cannot describe the joy from the remaining members of the crew.
As any medicine, there is side affects, but they've been reduced to nothing more harmful than a small fever now. The host of the virus remains alive.

We can finally return home with cures and return to Planet Opis as well with more materials after healing peoples on our planet.
The future of Janus can rest a bit more securely now. The crew is taking a brief rest now, but we intend on creating more of the formula and sending it back to Janus.
