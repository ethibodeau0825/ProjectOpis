Title: Deterioration

Conditions are continuing to worsen. From home, we only hear of JEIF taking more people instead of any semblance of respite.
The JEIF virus is currently being tested and treated with a mixture of minerals and herbs found and chosen off the surface of Opis.
While the current state of the cure alleviates the quality of life, the infected begin to deteriorate after a nondescript period of time.

The winter cycle is beginning on Opis as well. The cold is bitter and harsh on our bodies at night, only being safe to survey in the daytime for our few remaining crew.
Continuing the search for resources is incredibly difficult with our dwindling members as well. We can only hope that what we've sent back material-wise can be remade.

We are so tantalizingly close to finding a cure. We have everything we need - we just need to see where we went wrong.
This final batch of the formula has to be correct. The few of us are putting all of our faith in it. It must work.
We cannot lose any more than we already have. This has been too desperate and arduous of a fight to lose it now.
