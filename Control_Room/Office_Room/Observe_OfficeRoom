There are papers and binders all over the floor and desks. A desk has been overturned with a knocked-over chair to pair with it.
You see another Research Document on an unturned chair, a map on the desk nearby as well among other papers. 
Under crumpled papers you move aside for the map, you find a purple key as well.
 
In the corner, you see a toolbox nearby some shelving that is somehow relatively untouched. Why it's in here instead of put away remains unknown.

To move the key to the Control Room: mv Purple_key ~/ProjectOpis/Control_Room/Keychain
To see the map: cat map
To move the toolbox or document to the Control Room: ./.acquire.sh"
