You look around and take in the sight of a standard bedroom meant for communal living. It makes you feel hollow just to stand in this bedroom.
There is a few beds with some side side tables and chairs in the corner of the room. It's pretty organized in here too, but no one really slept anyway.

The bureau and shelf is standing directly opposite of the bed. You had shared it with others before they'd left. On the bureau is a lone green key.
On the left nightstand there is a research document with a plain notepad and pen.
You look around a bit more and find a purple key stashed under a chair too. It isn't up to you to question, but you can't help but wonder who hid this back here.

To move the document: ./.acquire.sh and type the name of the item as it shows in the directory
To move the key to the Control Room: mv Green_key ~/ProjectOpis/Control_Room/Keychain
To move the purple key: mv Pink_Key ~/ProjectOpis/Control_Room/Keychain"
mv .Pink_Key Pink_Key
mv .Green_Key Green_Key
