Title: Planet Opis

We have titled our newfound panacea planet as 'Opis'. Perhaps an etude to what may be an opus of a cure, for all we can hope.
Opis has countless mountain ranges with deep valleys of untested liquid. Her clouds hang low and make the peaks of the shortest mountains look insurmountable.
The temperature is a bit chilly as well, but our gear has prepared us for exploration. We have not seen any signs of standard life yet as well, despite our observations.

Our only hope is to continue to survey the land and test its minerals and fauna. Thanks to the ranges, the caves we have seen are abundant with untapped knowledge.
Further updates will be logged as we continue to obtain survey knowledge directly from those who explore the surface.
