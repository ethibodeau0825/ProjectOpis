**_Narrative_**

  You are Doctor Olaris Gamma, a resident of Janus and a key component of discovering a cure to a sickness only titled "JEIF." It killed your parents and might even kill your partner if you work any slower. At the moment, you and your late crew are suspended above Planet Opis - a planet filled with life and promising data that could save your people from sickness. Also, your measly crew the company sent with you had grown sick, and most were forced to stay back. The few that remained grew sicker and untreatable from the medicines the crew had created, and the remaining crewmate was now nowhere to be found...

  You worry for your own safety as well now. The ship seems strange after the turbulence, and you need to check the engine. Most of the doors automatically locked during the bout of turbulence, leaving you locked out of the *Med Room*, the *Office*, the *Chemical Lab*, and, to your dismay, the *Engine Room* as well. Your final job, it seems, is to just get home and bring peace of mind to the sickened people of Janus by delving into the data scattered about. You must find whatever damage has been done to the ship as well - else there will be no peace of mind to bring home, let alone a body to return to your partner.

**_Instructions_**
  
  Use *cd RoomName* to move between rooms, and *cd ..* to move back a room. *ls* will tell you the contens of the "room". The actual way to look around is "cat Observe_RoomName", which gives more insight to the room and its contents rather than just a list of names. Instructions are given further when you cat (concatenate) the Observe file for each room, so read carefully and consult the room for further aid.
