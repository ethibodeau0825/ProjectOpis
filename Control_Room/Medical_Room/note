Biological experimentation has gone devastatingly wrong. I'm so sorry to whoever finds them, if they even live that much longer.
The potential cure for the JEIF disease has proven to have horrid side effects on a crewmember. 
We can't go through with that batch. The plants of Opis are too unstable to utilize as medicine alone.

I locked them in the lab as well, but they have important documentation of our research. I'm sorry to those who find them after me.
