Title: Breakthrough of Usable Materials

Planet Opis has proved indescribably useful to our research. The ranges, which were once intimidating and vast, now offer us an opportunity at another life.
We plan on sending more to the surface to obtain more minerals and herbs to create and test more medicine to send home.
JEIF continues to take our people faster with each passing day, which makes the breakthrough of medicinal material a celebratory day to us here in orbit.

We currently are working on sending another team down as the log is created. We cannot leave Opis empty handed.
We have been gifted an ounce of a promise and we intend on hoping for the best until the very end.
