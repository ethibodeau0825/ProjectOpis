Title: Planetary System Located

To our surprise, the newly discovered planet is presumably the key to the JEIF cure. Allegedly, of course.
Despite its dangerous ecosystem and harsh environments, it hosts a relatively stable change in seasons based on our observations.

We will continue to study this planet further as well as investigate the surface with extreme caution.
