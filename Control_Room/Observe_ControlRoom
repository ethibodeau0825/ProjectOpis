echo "You look around the Control Room.
It's not very large, but it's probably the cleanest and most organized part of the ship.
Several screens look as they should, automating work that would have been done by a living organism... Had any been alive right now. 

You look around and see an out-of-place terminal. There is a bright screen telling you the engine is in need of repair. It must be from earlier...      

Most surrounding rooms are locked as well. The Engine Room is one of those locked rooms, to your dismay.
The other room keys must be scattered around. You recall one being in here, a blue key that goes to the Medical Room...

To move around: cd <Directory>
To move back: cd ..
To pick up items: ./.acquire.sh
To move keys: mv Blue_Key Keychain

*Hint: The Keychain is a directory that you can 'cd' to. In order to read each password, you must move the keys as instructed and 'cat' each key.*
*To read the password off the Blue Key in this case, type *cat Blue_Key*. Move them to your Keychain to access them easily in case you forget the password*.

*Consult the README.md for help if needed as you progress.*"
