echo "
Pushing open the door you are met with a horrific sight. The bloody, expiremented body of you missing crewmate is hunched over the desk.

They quickly turn their head as you walk in, their mangled face shaking you to the core. You had no idea the side affects could be so... So utterly dreadful.

You notice a cabinet on the other side of the room  
But to reach there you have to go through what used to be your friend.

Do you engage or leave them in peace?
